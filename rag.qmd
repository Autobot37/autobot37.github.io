<h1>Analysis with BERT and RAG Chatbot</h1>
<p>For detecting sentiments, topics, and previous conversations for crime analysis, I did the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Trained BERT for recognizing possible tones.</li>
    <li>Developed a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot which is able to fetch similar messages from an indexed database and answer based on that context.</li>
</ol>
<p>This makes text analysis very easy as it can find patterns based on vector embedding of text. Additionally, it can caption images too and describe connections.</p>
<p>We can automatically scrape 4chan too and perform automatic analysis. It prints a summary and topics discussed in the end. The default board is <code>/pol/</code> on 4chan.</p>
